# Useful4DevOps

My structured notes on DevOps.

## Thoughts:
- Bookmarks are typically not rich enough.
- Like passwords, bookmarks should really be sharable across browsers, but can't easily be!
  - Different browsers are needed because of different strengths.
  - YouTube has deliberately crippled Firefox support, but it has some great extras, like passFF.
  - Chrome-based browsers lack some powerful extras, but works better with some websites.
- Markdown is great because it is terse and has lots of support.
- GitHub can be better than a blog, because it shows Markdown, like HTML pages.
  - It can also be self-marketing.
- HTML is too feature-rich and verbose for most note writing.
- CherryTree can be better than both, but lacks markdown support.

## TODO
- Add philosophy and process/system sections.
  - Avoid nasty traps like regarding-as/fabricating-from (management) methodologies, like fake-Agile e.g. Scrum.

## Main Stuff
- [DevOps Tools](tools.md)
