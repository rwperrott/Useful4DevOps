# Useful4DevOps

My structured notes on DevOps.

    - Bookmarks are typically not rich enough.
    - Bookmarks should really be sharable across browsers
      - YouTube has deliberately crippled Firefox support.
      - Chrome-based browsers lack some powerful extensions/plugins.
    - Markdown is great, because it has terse markup and common support.
    - GitHub is better than a blog, because it shows Markdown, like HTML pages.
    - HTML is too feature-rich and verbose for most note writing.
    - CherryTree can be better than both, but lacks markdown support.

- TODO: Add philosophy and process/system sections.
  - Don't fall into a trap, like fake-Agile, of regarding-as/making methodologies
